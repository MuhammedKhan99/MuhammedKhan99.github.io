## Our Vision Statement

**A brilliant application that brings U of M students the ability to easily
manage and plan their courses.** ListMyCourses brings two things together: a
course scheduler and a course tracker. This integrated solution provides
students a useful tool for planning their courses and tracking their progress in
their programs, helping them succeed in achieving their educational goals.

## <ins> Intended User </ins>

ListMyCourses is mainly designed for U of M undergraduate students who seek
better organization for planning their courses. Our app aims to provide a
one-stop shop that allows students to plan their program with easy access to
information they may need such as pre-requisites, GPA, credit hours, weekly
schedules, and information about courses. This should prove to be useful for
many students as the current existing systems in place make it difficult to have
such an experience.

Professors will also be able to use ListMyCourses. This project shall allow
professors to define the requirements and grading schemes of the courses they
teach, giving students access to course information typically given in a
syllabus. For students taking their course, the professor will be able to
distribute grades on assignments and tests, allowing students to monitor their
performance.
